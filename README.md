# Extreme debloat & speedup for AT&T Samsung Galaxy A10e
Why is a 3GB GOT game preinstalled &amp; not uninstallable through the launcher?! LOL!!!

# How do I use this?
This is GitHub, bro! Plug the phone in, run 'sudo adb shell' on your Linux box, and use the commands from the 'debloat-commands' file. Some of the bloatware is installed under userspace and thus can not be uninstalled through this method, so for the remaining apps, just hold them down and hit 'Uninstall' in the launcher.
