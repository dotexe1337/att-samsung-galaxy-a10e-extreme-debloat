# Extreme debloat & speedup for AT&T Samsung Galaxy A10e
Why in the world is a GOT game preinstalled &amp; not uninstallable through the launcher?! LOL!!!

# How do I use this?
This is GitHub, bro! Plug the phone in, run 'sudo adb shell' on your Linux box, and use the commands from the 'debloat-commands' file.
